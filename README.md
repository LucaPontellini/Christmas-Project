# Christmas-Project

---

This project aims to create a data collection to manage the user and the cashier in a casino. The main goal is to develop a system that can handle a user's information, with the possibility of expanding the system to support more users. The project will integrate with another existing project ([Ponte's Casino](https://github.com/LucaPontellini/End-of-Year-Project-for-Computer-Science-Poker-.git)), using a data file managed only by the casino owner, who will have the credentials to access user information.
